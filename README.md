# Responsive Web App with Tailwind CSS The user wants a JSON object with three keys: `index.html`, `README.md`, and `LICENSE`. I need to generate content for each of these.

**`README.md`**:
- The user explicitly stated "PRIMARY GOAL: write readme.md".
- The `input.md` content should be used for the `README.md`.
- It needs to be professional.

**`index.html`**:
- Must be a single-file responsive HTML app using Tailwind CSS.
- Should reference images using `<img src='filename'>` if any are mentioned (though none are in `input.md` or the prompt for HTML itself).
- I will create a basic responsive landing page structure using Tailwind.

**`LICENSE`**:
- Must contain the full MIT license text.

Let's break down the content generation:

**1. `README.md`**:
The `input.md` is provided. I need to make sure it's incorporated professionally.
Since `input.md` content isn't given in the prompt, I will have to assume a generic but professional structure for a README based on typical project documentation. I will structure it with a title, description, features, installation, usage, and license section. I will then mention `input.md` content might be integrated into the description or features, but since I don't have it, I'll create a placeholder for it and general project info.

*Self-correction*: The prompt states "The following attachments are provided (saved in the same folder): - input.md". It doesn't actually provide the *content* of `input.md`. This means I have to *infer* or *create* content for `README.md` while acknowledging `input.md` exists. Given "PRIMARY GOAL: write readme.md", I should write a complete, professional README. I will assume `input.md` contains the core project description or details and integrate it conceptually, stating that "Further details are available in `input.md`" or "This project's core functionality is described in `input.md`." However, the instruction is "Use these exact file names in your HTML (for example: <img src='sample.png'>)." This refers to image attachments, not markdown files. So, I should write the README *as if* `input.md` has been incorporated or is supplementary. I will write a general professional README.

Let's assume `input.md` contains the *main project description* and I should integrate it. Since I don't have its content, I will *generate* a suitable project description that would typically be found in `input.md` and then embed it into the README.

Okay, let's refine the `README.md` approach. I will create a professional README structure and for the project description, I will write a placeholder or a generic description that makes sense for a "responsive HTML app using Tailwind CSS", hinting that `input.md` *could* have provided more specific details. Since `input.md` is mentioned as an *attachment*, I should not try to parse its content, but rather write a README *for a project that might use such an `input.md`*.

*Revised `README.md` plan*:
1.  **Title**: Project Name
2.  **Description**: A brief overview of the project, perhaps mentioning it's a responsive app using Tailwind. I will include a note about `input.md` here, e.g., "For detailed project specifications and core requirements, please refer to `input.md`." This satisfies the requirement of acknowledging the attachment without needing its content.
3.  **Features**: List common features for such an app.
4.  **Technologies**: Tailwind CSS, HTML.
5.  **Installation**: How to run it.
6.  **Usage**: How to interact.
7.  **License**: Link to the MIT license.
8.  **Contact/Contributing**: Optional, but good for professionalism.

**2. `index.html`**:
- Single-file, responsive.
- Tailwind CSS. I will use the CDN for simplicity.
- Basic structure: Header, Main Content (hero section, feature section, call to action), Footer.
- Ensure responsiveness using Tailwind's utility classes (e.g., `md:`, `lg:` prefixes).
- No specific content requested for HTML, so I'll create generic sections.
- No images are mentioned for *this* HTML, so I won't use `<img src='filename'>`. The prompt says "If image attachments are mentioned below, reference them using <img src='filename'> exactly as provided." No images were mentioned *for the HTML content*.

**3. `LICENSE`**:
- Full MIT License text.

Let's start drafting the content.
